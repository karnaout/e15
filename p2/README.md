## Notes for instructor
+ Search objects field only works now if you enter the exact object slug.
+ Form validation is been demonstrated on the Create a new object form.
+ There's a big room for improvement especially in CSS. Show object name/description works for one items at a time. So showing one item will hide the other in this version. 
+ There is a lot more clean up can be done and perhapse re-naming some classes, functions, methods, pages with more descriptive names. I esentially solved this problem in a slightly differnet way but eventually changed it to this current version of the app. but you might still find traces of the old approach I took even though I tried to clean up my code as much as possible.
